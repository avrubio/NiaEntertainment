    <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-center">NIA Records (1979 – 1986)</h1>

    <div class="grid items-center mx-auto max-w-[900px]">
      <p class="py-2">
        Nia Records, founded in 1979 by twins, TaharQa and Tunde Ra Aleem,
        became one of the premier independent record labels by launching the
        careers of several industry legends and bridging the gap between
        traditional disco and house/club music. By 1979, the Aleem twins were
        already veterans of the music industry. They grew weary of the
        traditional “demo-shopping” approach to getting signed to a major label
        and decided to borrow $1500 from their father to press their own
        records, and thus, Nia Records was off and running.
      </p>

      <p class="py-2">
        Their first single release on Nia under the name Aleem, 1979’s Hooked On
        Your Love, featured Leroy Burgess (formerly of Black Ivory) on lead
        vocals, with Jocelyn Brown, Crystal Davis and Luther Vandross on
        background vocals (his first recorded work). The recording was an
        immediate hit in the clubs and ushered in the early transitional phase
        from disco to club/dance music in NYC. The track spent four months (16
        weeks) on the national disco charts, peaking at #15, and was played
        relentlessly by DJ Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage. The following
        year in 1980 it was re-released with a phenomenal remix by John Morales.
        Nia Records would go on to release several singles under various names
        (The Fantastic Aleems, High Frequency, Alias, Caprice, Supreme Force,
        Gina, TSOB Crew, Double Image, The Eko, Billy Jones, etc.).
      </p>

      <p class="py-2">
        What followed was a string of successful hit singles by which Nia
        Records, pioneered the market for 12-inch dance records. Nia Records
        became known for having its ear to the street and was pivotal in
        changing the face of the old-styled discos into hip dance clubs. With
        rap and street culture starting to emerge in the early 80’s, it was only
        logical for Nia Records to venture into hip hop music.
      </p>

      <p class="py-2">
        Nia Records was able to give fledgling hip-hop artists major exposure to
        a wider audience. Hip-hop legends and pioneers like Captain Rock (Cosmic
        Glide), Lonnie Love (AKA Alonzo Brown AKA Mr. Hyde from the rap group
        Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Marley Marl/MC Shan (Marley’s Scratch), Sparky
        D/DJ Red Alert, Intelligent Hoodlum AKA Tragedy Khadafi (Super Kids),
        and The Last Poet (Abiodun Oyewole) (Super Horror Show), all recorded on
        Nia Records.
      </p>

      <p class="py-2">
        The next smash single on NIA Records, 1984’s Release Yourself, was a
        dance floor hit, thanks to the hip-hop styled remix by Marley Marl. The
        legendary trailblazing Hip-Hop pioneer’s first venture into digital
        sampling on wax was on Release Yourself, an innovative act at that time.
        The suggestion of this remix was made by Mr. Magic, whose WBLS show, Mr.
        Magic's Rap Attack, was just beginning to take over NYC’s urban radio
        airwaves. (Release Yourself was later sampled by many hip-hop artists
        including the 2 Live Crew, Method Man, and Missy Elliot.)
      </p>

      <p class="py-2">
        With the mid-80’s in full swing, the Aleems continued to put out smash
        dance singles like <strong>Get Loose</strong> (1984) and
        <strong>Confusion </strong>(1985), both featuring Leroy Burgess on lead
        vocals. Both singles were remixed and released in Europe. The last
        record released on Nia Records was the compilation album N.Y.C. Crazy
        Def Jams in 1986. It was a fitting end to an era, which featured some of
        the best and brightest to ever be featured on the label. Captain Rock,
        Sparky D, DJ Red Alert, Marly Marl, MC Shan, The Super Kids, and D’Bora
        were all included on the album.
      </p>

      <p class="py-2">
        Nia Records went on a hiatus from 1986 up until the present day, but the
        company’s ideals were always ever present in the hearts and minds of its
        artists, producers, and contributors, as they took their talents to
        other projects and became trendsetters and pioneers. Since Nia Records
        never left, it’s appropriate to re-introduce Nia Records to a new
        generation, as it is back with a vengeance and ready to resume its place
        as a forward-thinking label.
